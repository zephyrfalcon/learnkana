TODO:

- options need to be stored
- options could be moved to separate component?
- add some hiragana
- show katakana and/or hiragana depending on options
- radiobuttons need to show correct selection when we move back

- don't always start with the same kana; pick a random kana when we start
  (probably needs to be done in a special method?)

- add instructions

- FIXME: kana tables will have "holes" in them; this is currently not handled
  - will handle it when we run into it
  - whole table writing structure might need to be replaced; e.g. we could
    simply create a table and mark the cells with (row, column) and then look
    up the matching kana, if any

- case should be irrelevant for the answers given!
  i.e. convert to lowercase

- technically I should be able to replace KatakanaTable and HiraganaTable with
  just calls to KanaTable and the appropriate prop, but I don't know (yet) how
  to do this with the current setup. (App calls <this.state.component />; I need
  to figure out how to pass props to this.

- later: include digraphs?
- potentially add a way to limit the number of kana selected? e.g. it would
  make sense to say "only the first 3 rows in the table" etc, but this might be
  a bit user-unfriendly.

- option: when we guess wrong, show somewhere what the kana was
  (is currently not shown)

- styling of tables needs to be better, esp. empty spaces

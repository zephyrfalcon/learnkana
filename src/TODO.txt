TODO:

- options need to be stored
- options could be moved to separate component?
- add some hiragana
- show katakana and/or hiragana depending on options
- radiobuttons need to show correct selection when we move back

- add instructions
- add katakana/hiragana tables
  - idea: instead of key: value, use an array of objects like this:
    let katakana = [
      {symbol: "ã‚¢", value: "a", position: [1,1]},
      ...
    where the position indicates where it appears in the table that we
    must render.
    it seems inefficient though, because when rendering we will need to scan
    the table each time to find the symbol at the position (x,y) we're currently
    at. fortunately the tables aren't large.
    of course the code that selects symbols must be updated.

- case should be irrelevant for the answers given!
  i.e. convert to lowercase

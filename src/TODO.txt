TODO:

- add some hiragana

- add instructions

- technically I should be able to replace KatakanaTable and HiraganaTable with
  just calls to KanaTable and the appropriate prop, but I don't know (yet) how
  to do this with the current setup. (App calls <this.state.component />; I need
  to figure out how to pass props to this.

- later: include digraphs?
- potentially add a way to limit the number of kana selected? e.g. it would
  make sense to say "only the first 3 rows in the table" etc, but this might be
  a bit user-unfriendly.

- option: when we guess wrong, show somewhere what the kana was
  (is currently not shown)

- styling of tables needs to be better, esp. empty spaces

TODO:

- later: include digraphs?
- potentially add a way to limit the number of kana selected? e.g. it would
  make sense to say "only the first 3 rows in the table" etc, but this might be
  a bit user-unfriendly.
- add and show version number somewhere, and perhaps copyright message

OPTIONAL/LATER:

- have an option to show the tables in a different layout, i.e. length-wise
  (useful for people with super high resolutions that can fit the whole table
  on their screens)

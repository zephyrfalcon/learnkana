TODO:

- options need to be stored
- options could be moved to separate component?
- add some hiragana
- show katakana and/or hiragana depending on options
- radiobuttons need to show correct selection when we move back

- don't always start with the same kana; pick a random kana when we start
  (probably needs to be done in a special method?)

- add instructions
- add katakana/hiragana tables
  - to show the tables, we need to group by row... we really need a nested
    array, then map over that to do the <tr>s, then map over the contents 
    (should also be an array with up to 5 kana objects) to do the <td>s 
  - these should of course be rendered by the KanaSymbol component 

- case should be irrelevant for the answers given!
  i.e. convert to lowercase
